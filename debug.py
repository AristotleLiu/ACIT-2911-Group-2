# Push the application context to make the necessary application resources available
app.app_context().push()

"""
The code above pushes the application context, which makes the necessary
resources and configurations of the Flask application available. This step
is required to properly interact with the application and its components,
such as database connections, models, and other dependencies.

Note:
    This assumes that the 'app' module has been imported and initialized,
    and the necessary configurations have been set.
